/// in and we want to write to the location of the data the pointer points to.
/// - Second ":" we have the input parameters which is our "new" context. We only read from this data.
/// - Third ":" This our clobber list, this is information to the compiler that these registers can't be used freely
/// - Fourth ":" This is options we can pass inn, Rust has 3: "alignstack", "volatile" and "intel"
/// 
/// For this to work (partially) on windows we need to use "alignstack" where the compiler adds the neccesary padding to
/// make sure our stack is aligned.
/// 
/// One last important part (it will not work without this) is the #[naked] attribute. Basically this lets us have full
/// control over the stack layout since normal functions has a prologue-and epilogue added by the
/// compiler that will cause trouble for us. We avoid this by marking the funtion as "Naked".
